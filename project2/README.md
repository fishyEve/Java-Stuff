Program 2 is a mock situation of a Mario Kart tornument. This program allows a user
to register competitors, search them up through their ID or name, and then perform time trials.
The time trials are randomized results that produce the times in which each competitors finished
four races (one cup). The user can then display statistics of those races and can perform another
to populate different results. This entire program is driven by a menu.
